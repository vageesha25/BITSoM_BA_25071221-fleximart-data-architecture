# Part 2: NoSQL Database Analysis and MongoDB Implementation

## Overview

This module evaluates the limitations of relational databases for handling highly diverse and evolving product data. MongoDB is analyzed and implemented as a NoSQL alternative to support flexible schemas, nested documents, and scalable data storage.

---

## Objectives

- Analyze limitations of RDBMS for flexible product catalogs
- Justify the use of MongoDB for semi-structured data
- Implement basic MongoDB operations on product data

---

## Key Components

### NoSQL Analysis
- `nosql_analysis.md` explains:
  - Limitations of relational databases
  - Benefits of MongoDB (schema flexibility, embedded documents, scalability)
  - Trade-offs of using NoSQL systems

### MongoDB Operations
- `mongodb_operations.js` includes:
  - Data import into MongoDB collection
  - Filtering and querying documents
  - Aggregation using pipelines
  - Update operations on nested data

### Sample Data
- `products_catalog.json` contains product documents
- Includes nested specifications and customer reviews

---

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB
- MongoDB Shell (mongosh)
- JSON

---

## Outcome

This module demonstrates how NoSQL databases complement relational systems by handling dynamic schemas and nested data structures, making them suitable for flexible product catalogs and modern applications.
